                                According to our research, we have found that different office
                                chairs are suitable for different body types, so you need to
                                take some measurements before buying.

                                <span>A. Seat Height Measurement:</span> Measure the height
                                from your knee to your feet, ensuring your feet are flat on
                                the ground when seated. Your thighs should be parallel to the
                                floor.

                                Measure the distance from your thigh to your knee. The seat
                                depth should be such that 3 or 4 fingers(Greater than or equal
                                to 50mm) can pass between the front edge of the seat and the
                                lower leg.

                                In addition to this, the lumbar support of the office chair
                                should match the natural lumbar curvature of the user’s back.
                                The arm height should be such that the forearm can easily
                                reach them but not be in the way when using a keyboard or
                                mouse.

                                The price range of office chairs varies widely, from less than
                                €100 to €2000, making it crucial to select one that best fits
                                your budget. Chair prices are influenced by factors such as

                                Seat Tilt: The angle of the seat should be such that you feel
                                most comfortable in an upright posture. The seat tilt can be
                                adjusted to provide an angle that counterbalances good
                                posture: feet flat, back comfortably resting on the chair’s
                                back. Adjust as needed to create a seating surface that gently
                                pulls you back to the chair as you sit in a strong, upright
                                posture.

                                The ability of lumbar support is a critical feature designed
                                to provide the correct support for the natural curve of your
                                spine, particularly the lower back, or lumbar region. Good
                                lumbar support can help to prevent back strain and muscle
                                fatigue, allowing you to sit for longer periods while
                                maintaining good posture.

                                Back Recline: This feature allows you to adjust your sitting
                                angle. Most ergo chairs will allow for between 90 and 120
                                degrees of tilt, though some will let you recline all the way
                                back. With a good back recline feature, you should be able to
                                sit in a position that is comfortable for you and supports the
                                natural curvature of the spine. A back recline function is
                                especially important for people who work at the desk for
                                extended periods of time as it helps to reduce the pressure on
                                your spine and lower back.

                                Tilt tension control determines the amount of resistance
                                you’ll feel when leaning back in your chair. By adjusting the
                                tilt tension, you can control the ease or difficulty of
                                reclining in your chair, allowing for comfortable and
                                controlled reclining. The perfect tilt tension will give you a
                                sense of weightlessness and allow you to move easily in the
                                chair.

                                same angle. This can be beneficial for maintaining postural
